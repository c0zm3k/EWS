# Student Risk Monitor | Analytics Command Center

A high-fidelity, industrial skeuomorphic web application for monitoring and predicting student academic risk. This system transforms raw academic data into tactical diagnostic readouts using a tactile control panel interface.

## 🕹️ System Interface
The UI is designed as an **Industrial Control Panel**, featuring:
- **Tactile Tactility**: Physical bevels, recessed wells, and brushed metal textures.
- **Dynamic Telemetry**: LED status indicators (Nominal vs. Alert) and glowing technical readouts.
- **Interactive Analytics**: Enlargable high-resolution charts for variance visualization.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Predictive Engine**: Analyzes Attendance, Midterm Scores, and CGPA to determine unit risk probability.
- **Unit Diagnostic Panels**: Individual high-fidelity readouts for every student, featuring "System Tech Notes" and personalized monikers.
- **Name-Enabled Pipeline**: Full support for student names throughout the data stream and UI.
- **Data Export/Import**: Integrated demo data generator for system calibration and testing.
